# retro68k

A homebrew Motorola 68000 computer with Amiga-style shared memory and an FPGA handling video and audio. It runs on a **ZX Spectrum Next KS3** board: the 68000 is a core inside the board's Artix-7 FPGA, and main memory is the board's fast SRAM.

## Goals

- **CPU:** 68000 at 20 MHz, the fx68k core inside the FPGA
- **Memory:** 4 MB of Amiga-style Chip RAM in fast SRAM, shared with DMA in fixed memory cycles; the CPU has its own cycle in every slot, so it never waits for Chip RAM
- **ROM:** boot ROM with a monitor, held in FPGA block RAM
- **Video:** HDMI and VGA in one mode, 576p (720×576 at 50 Hz, the digital form of PAL; a PAL Amiga screen sits in a centred window); 3 bitmap layers, planar or chunky, with Amiga-style bitplane pointers; scaling 1–8×; 256-colour palette or direct colour; a copper (MOVE, WAIT, SKIP)
- **Audio:** 4 Paula-style channels of 8-bit samples, sigma-delta output
- **DMA engine:** one channel for copies and fills in Chip RAM, in 1D or 2D
- **I/O:** USB serial (FT232H module), SD card (SPI), PS/2 keyboard, timers, interrupts

## Status

The computer runs in simulation (`make -C sim`): fx68k boots the ROM, checks memory, interrupts and video, and prints to the USB serial link and the screen. The boot ROM draws its console text into a 1-plane bitmap layer with a font in ROM; the picture at the bottom right is a second bitmap layer, fetched from Chip RAM as the beam scans:

## Design plan

Decisions, memory map, phases and open questions are in [`docs/design-plan.md`](docs/design-plan.md). Each block has a spec in [`docs/spec/`](docs/spec/).

## Toolchain

- **68000 code:** `vasm` (Motorola syntax) or `m68k-elf-gcc`
- **FPGA:** Vivado (free edition), scripted with Tcl; simulation with Verilator and Icarus Verilog
- **Loading:** JTAG during development (`fpga/ks3/build.sh --program`, see [`fpga/ks3/README.md`](fpga/ks3/README.md)); installed as a Next core when finished

## Roadmap

1. [ ] FPGA bring-up: HDMI/VGA test pattern, USB serial echo
2. [x] Whole computer in simulation: boot ROM checks on the serial link and the screen
3. [ ] Computer on the board: "hello" on a monitor, RAM test, boot monitor (build script ready: `fpga/ks3/build.sh`)
4. [ ] Video: bitmap layers, palette, scrolling (version 1 done in simulation), copper. Sprites were built and then removed from version 1 to save logic
5. [ ] Audio: 4 sample channels
6. [ ] DMA engine: copies and fills
7. [ ] Home computer: SD card, PS/2 keyboard, BASIC
8. [ ] Installed as a Next core
