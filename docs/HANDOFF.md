# Handoff

State of the project on 23 October 2026 (evening): every unit of version 1 is built and tested in simulation, and the Vivado build meets timing. For picking the work up in a new session (VS Code, or a fresh Claude session). Read this first, then `docs/design-plan.md` for the whole plan.

## What retro68k is

An Amiga-style 68000 computer on the ZX Spectrum Next KS3 board (Xilinx XC7A35T, 4 MB SRAM): fx68k at 20 MHz, 576p video over HDMI and VGA with three layers and 8 scalable sprites, a copper, 4-channel audio, a 4-channel DMA engine and blitter, an SD card, a PS/2 keyboard, and serial over an FT232H. The specs are in `docs/spec/`, the programming guide (Amiga Hardware Reference Manual style) in `docs/guide/`.

## Working rules

- Commit and push straight to `main` of `jonsole/retro68k`. No pull requests unless asked.
- Author: `Jon Sole <jon.sole@gmail.com>` (`git -c user.name="Jon Sole" -c user.email="jon.sole@gmail.com" commit ...`).
- Claude's commits end with a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer (and the session link, if the session gives one). No model names anywhere else in the repo.
- Check CI (GitHub Actions, `.github/workflows/checks.yml`) after each push. A full run takes about 35–50 minutes.
- Every hardware change: spec first (`docs/spec/`), then RTL, then the test, then the guide. Keep the specs matching the RTL: when the build differs, change the spec in the same commit.
- Run the tests before pushing RTL; CI runs only the `spr` video screen (see below).
- Keep the design under about 85% of the LUTs by Vivado's count (17,680), so it routes at 100 MHz. Yosys (the CI check) counts about a third more than Vivado; it fails CI past 130% by its own count (about 97% by Vivado's).
- Run the Vivado build after RTL changes: timing at 100 MHz is met with little margin (+0.2 ns).

## Tools

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Icarus Verilog 12 or 13 | `iverilog`, `vvp`. CI uses Ubuntu's; 13 is stricter (no use before declaration) |
| sv2v | Converts fx68k from SystemVerilog. Release v0.0.13 from github.com/zachjs/sv2v |
| vasm | Build from the vendored copy: `tar xzf tools/vasm/vasm.tar.gz && make -C vasm CPU=m68k SYNTAX=mot`, then put `vasm/` on `PATH` (`vasmm68k_mot`) |
| Python 3 | Pillow for the PNG output (optional) |
| Yosys | For the size check (`fpga/ks3/yosys_check.sh`) |
| Verilator 5 | For the lint (`fpga/lint.sh`). MSYS2 UCRT64 package `verilator` (lint only needs no C++ build) |
| Vivado | 2026.1. `VIVADO=/c/AMDDesignTools/2026.1/Vivado/bin/vivado.bat bash fpga/ks3/build.sh`. Builds a bitstream (`fpga/ks3/build/retro68k_ks3.bit`) in about 15 minutes; timing met. Not tried on the board yet (it arrives in early November) |

### Windows

The tools are installed on Jon's Windows machine: MSYS2 (`C:/msys64`, UCRT64 packages: gcc, make, iverilog, yosys, verilator, python, python-pillow), sv2v in `C:/tools/sv2v/sv2v-Windows`, vasm built into `C:/tools/vasmsrc/vasm`. All are on the user PATH. Run the Makefiles from an MSYS2 shell (`C:/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe -l`, with `/ucrt64/bin` first on the PATH), not with Chocolatey's `make`. The repo is checked out with `core.autocrlf=false`: the Python tools need LF files.

## Building and testing

All from `sim/` unless noted. See `sim/README.md` for more options.

| Command | What it checks | Time | In CI |
|---------|---------------|------|-------|
| `python3 tools/regmap.py --verify` (repo root) | `fpga/regmap.def` against `docs/spec/registers.md` and the generated `hw.inc`, `hw.h`, `regmap.vh` | seconds | yes |
| `make run ARGS=+serial` | Boot ROM self-test, serial echo, BREAK and RESET | 5–50 min | yes |
| `make run ARGS=+dma` | Boot ROM with the DMA port busy | 5–50 min | yes |
| `make ctest` | Copper: self-checking ROM, then 14 colour changes checked in the frame (`ctest/ccheck.py`) | 10–80 min | yes |
| `make atest` | Audio: every output sample against a Python model | 3–10 min | yes |
| `make dtest` | DMA engine: 48 random jobs on 4 channels, every byte of 1 MB against `dtest/dmodel.py`; then 15 directed tests (palettes, ROM, registers, errors, STOP, PAUSE, ports, HIGH, a timer start). `SEED=n` picks other random jobs | 1 min | yes |
| `make iotest` | SD card (start-up, a block read and written by DMA) and PS/2 keyboard (bytes, a bad frame, sending), against `sd_model.v` and `ps2_model.v` | 5 min | yes |
| `make rtest` | The 68000 RESET instruction: the devices are reset; the CPU, overlay, memory, watchdog, RESETWHY and time counter are not | 1 min | yes |
| `make vtest` | Video: four screens (`pal`, `direct`, `spr`, `share`) checked pixel by pixel against `vtest/vmodel.py`; `make vtest VTESTS=spr` runs one. Each palette gets different colours; `spr` has the 8 sprites at many scales; `share` is `spr` with VIDCON.SHAREPAL | 45 min each | `spr` only |
| `bash fpga/ks3/yosys_check.sh` (repo root) | Synthesis for the XC7A35T and the LUT count | 3 min | yes |
| `sh fpga/lint.sh` (repo root) | Verilator lint: a value cut short to fit (WIDTHTRUNC) is an error; slice it or waive the line | 10 s | yes |

`make BUILD=other_dir ...` builds into another directory, so a second set of runs can go alongside the first (`sim/build*/` is ignored by git). Run long simulations in the background, one per directory. The times above are for 7 runs side by side on a 16-core machine. Don't change `vtest/vmodel.py` or other test scripts while a suite that uses them is running. Edit `regmap.def`, then run `python3 tools/regmap.py` to regenerate the headers; never edit `hw.inc`, `hw.h` or `regmap.vh` by hand.

Debug switches in `sim/tb.v`:
- `+sprdbg`: sprite fetcher state at each frame start, and counts of acks, words and opaque pixels at the end.
- `+xstop`: stops at the first unknown (`x`) value on the sprite channel to the scheduler, and dumps the state.
- `+timeout=N`: the run's time limit in ns.
- `+dumpram=FILE`: Chip RAM `0x0F0000`–`0x1FFFFF` at the end (the DMA test); `+dmxsend`: the PC sends 64 bytes (the DMA test's port job); `+iotest`: the keyboard sends its test bytes.

## Where things stand

Done and tested in simulation:

| Part | Files | Tests |
|------|-------|-------|
| CPU, bus, SRAM, scheduler (`dmac.v`, with HIGH and CPUSHARE), boot ROM (second port for DMA) | `fpga/rtl/`, `firmware/boot/boot.s` | boot |
| Video: 3 layers, planar/chunky, scaling, scroll, BPLSTRIDE, priority, direct colour, a palette per layer and one for the sprites (SHAREPAL for one) | `video.v`, `bpldma.v`, `layer_pix.v` | vtest pal, direct, share |
| Sprites: 8, any size, 2/4/8 bpp, fractional scaling across and down (SPRxSTEP, 5.11, 16× to 1/16), depth, collisions, FIFO per sprite, changes while drawn, reuse down the screen, manual mode (SPRxDAT) | `sprites.v`, `sprite_pix.v`, `video.v` | vtest spr, share |
| Copper: MOVE/WAIT/SKIP/JUMP, MOVR, ALU, SKIPC, CALL/RET, RESUME | `copper.v`, `firmware/include/copper.inc` | ctest |
| Audio: 4 channels, 8/16-bit, pan, interpolation | `audio.v` | atest |
| DMA engine and blitter: 4 channels, COPY/FILL/KEYCOPY/LOGIC/ADD at 1/2/4/8 bpp, 2D, DESC, descriptor chains or direct job registers, registers/palettes/ROM, ports 0 (SD) and 1 (serial), HIGH, timer starts | `dmx.v` | dtest |
| SD card: SPI byte master, SDCOUNT for DMA port 0 | `sdspi.v` | iotest |
| PS/2 keyboard: receive with FIFO, send | `ps2kb.v` | iotest |
| Serial, interrupts, timers | `serial.v`, `intc.v`, `timers.v` | boot |
| The 68000 RESET instruction: resets the devices (not the CPU, overlay, watchdog, time counter or USB link) | `retro68k.v` (`dev_rst`), `timers.v` | rtest |

Size (Vivado): 15,730 LUTs (75.6%), 12 block RAM tiles, 8 DSP slices. Timing met at 100 MHz, worst setup slack +0.247 ns (in the audio engine, channel select to sample position), hold +0.027 ns. Per-unit figures from before the sprite rework: video 4,964 (sprites.v 1,809, the 8 sprite pixel units 779, bpldma.v 923), DMA engine 2,327, audio 1,225, copper 665, SD 66, keyboard 87.

### Recent decisions to know about

- **Beam coordinates** (spec 4, section 3.3). (0, 0) is the start of the horizontal and vertical blanks, so the picture is beam pixels 144–863 and lines 49–624. `hw.inc` has `VID_X0` = 144, `VID_Y0` = 49. Layer settings for line n must be written before line n starts; colours, BGCOLOR and PRIO can still change in line n's blank.
- **Sprites** have unsigned positions and are clipped at all four edges. No flips. A write to SPRxCTL starts a sprite and the vertical blank stops them all, so each frame the registers are written with CTL last; PT, H, V and STEP act on a running sprite from the next line (wobbles, zooms, image switches). The fetcher works a line at a time (settings frozen at beam pixels 840-847, a line-start pass at pixel 0, the pixel side takes them at pixel 12), so HSTART must be 16 or more. A sprite in manual mode (SPRxDAT) should not be shrunk across.
- **Sprite scaling**: screen pixel i shows source pixel ⌊i × XSTEP ÷ 2048⌋; the image is ⌈window × step ÷ 2048⌉. Shrinking across fetches every word (costs memory cycles in proportion); shrinking down skips lines.
- **DMA engine**: job registers laid out as a descriptor; RUN runs them, START loads CHDESC first; NEXT chains. Register targets keep the register rules (COPY/FILL, 8 bpp, long-aligned, forwards), and are written whole, so strobes fire once. REGLIST was dropped (a COPY into registers does it). LOGIC and ADD take memory or VALUE, not ports. Channels take turns by groups of 8 words.
- **SD card**: software does the SPI-mode protocol; the hardware moves bytes, and DMA moves blocks. No interrupt.
- **Area technique.** Per-channel state in distributed RAM, worked on one channel at a time (as in `bpldma.v`, `sprites.v`, `dmx.v`), rather than flip-flop arrays with wide muxes.

## Next jobs

In rough order:

1. **Try the bitstream on the board** (early November): HDMI and VGA at 576p, the boot ROM's console, the serial link, then the SD card and keyboard (`fpga/ks3/README.md` says what to expect).
2. **Boot ROM**: SD card start-up and a small FAT32 reader to load programs (spec 15, section 4); a keyboard decoder and layout table (spec 16); ROMLOCK.
3. **Timing margin**: +0.25 ns. The closest path is now in the audio engine (channel select to the sample position's enable); the sprite deadline calculator is pipelined.
4. **Small items**:
   - the serial link surviving a reset (spec);
   - the SD card and keyboard on the board (spec 15, SD1; spec 16, K3).
5. **Guide chapter** for audio (chapter 7 in the Amiga order).
6. **Trims**, if room is needed: timers, the audio engine, the copper's storage registers.
7. **Optional**: the TG68K 68020 option (`docs/tg68k-feasibility.md`).

### Known gaps

- Only the `spr` video screen is in CI (its own job, about an hour); `pal`, `direct` and `share` run locally.
- Sprite open points (spec 9, section 9): S1, measure the memory budget table in simulation; S2, whether sprites' share of free cycles should be capped.
- The DMA engine's speed figures (spec 11, section 7, open point D2) and the HIGH CPU shares are worked out, not measured.
- The SD test covers single blocks; multi-block transfers (CMD18, CMD25) are left to software and untested.
