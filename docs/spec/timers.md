# Spec 12: Timers

Status: **draft for review**

Timers give software a sense of time: a steady tick for the operating system, tempo for music players, timeouts, delays and measuring how long code takes. They live in the **system area** at `0xF00000` (with the interrupt controller and serial port), so DMA jobs and the copper cannot change them.

## 1. Summary

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Time counter | 64-bit, counts at 100 MHz (10 ns), never stops or wraps in practice (over 5,800 years) |
| General timers | 4, each with a 32-bit counter and a 16-bit prescaler |
| What they count | Prescaled 100 MHz clock, video lines, video frames, or another timer running out (to chain timers) |
| Modes | One-shot or repeating |
| When a timer runs out | Interrupt (level 6, vectored), and/or start a DMA engine channel with no CPU work |
| Watchdog | Resets the computer if software stops kicking it in time; a register says why the last reset happened |

## 2. Comparison with the Amiga

| Feature | Amiga (two CIA 8520 chips) | retro68k |
|---------|----------------------------|----------|
| Timers | 4 (2 per CIA), 16-bit | 4, 32-bit, with a 16-bit prescaler each |
| Timer clock | Fixed, about 0.7 MHz | 100 MHz ÷ (1 to 65,536), e.g. exactly 1 MHz |
| Chaining | Timer B can count timer A | Any timer can count the one before it |
| Other count sources | CNT pin | Video lines and frames |
| Time of day | 24-bit counter of frames or mains cycles | 64-bit 10 ns time counter |
| Starting other hardware | No | A timer can start a DMA channel |
| Watchdog | No | Yes |

## 3. Time counter

- **TIME** is a 64-bit counter that adds 1 every 10 ns from power-on. It cannot be written.
- Reading it as 16-bit halves (as the 68000 does) could catch it half-way through a carry. So **reading the highest 16 bits captures all 64 bits at that instant**, and the next three reads return the captured rest. Reading TIMEHI then TIMELO with MOVE.L, high first, gives one consistent value.
- Uses: timestamps, profiling ("how many 10 ns ticks did this routine take"), timeouts that never need resetting.

## 4. General timers

### 4.1 How a timer works

Each timer has a **COUNT** that goes down by 1 on each tick of its source. When it would go below 0 (**underflow**):

- **Repeating mode:** COUNT is reloaded from **RELOAD** and counting goes on. A timer with RELOAD = n fires every n + 1 ticks.
- **One-shot mode:** the timer stops (EN clears itself).
- In either mode, the timer can raise an **interrupt**, start a **DMA channel**, and count as a tick for the next timer.

Writing COUNT sets it directly. Writing RELOAD takes effect at the next underflow, so a repeating timer's period can be changed without a glitch.

### 4.2 What a timer counts

| SRC | Ticks on | Use |
|-----|----------|-----|
| 0 | The 100 MHz clock divided by (PRESCALE + 1) | Fixed rates. PRESCALE = 99 gives exactly 1 MHz (1 µs ticks) |
| 1 | The start of each video line | Line-based timing, e.g. "every 10 lines" |
| 2 | The start of each frame (vertical blanking) | Frame counting, e.g. "every 3 frames" |
| 3 | The previous timer's underflow (timer 0 counts timer 3) | Chaining: two timers make a 64-bit timer, or a slow timer counts a fast one |

PRESCALE only applies to SRC 0.

### 4.3 Examples

| Want | Setting |
|------|---------|
| Operating system tick, 1000 Hz | SRC 0, PRESCALE 99 (1 MHz), RELOAD 999, repeating, interrupt |
| Music at 125 BPM with 24 ticks per beat (50 Hz) | SRC 0, PRESCALE 99, RELOAD 19,999, repeating, interrupt |
| Timeout of 2 seconds | SRC 0, PRESCALE 99, COUNT 1,999,999, one-shot, interrupt |
| Refill an audio stream half without the CPU | Any rate, repeating, start DMA channel 2 (whose chain copies the next block) |
| Exact delay in video lines | SRC 1, COUNT n, one-shot |

Video lines and frames are counted from the video timing (spec 4), so they tick even when video output is blank, as long as the timing generator runs.

## 5. Watchdog

The watchdog resets the computer if software hangs.

- Software sets a time (WDTIME, in milliseconds, 1–65,535) and turns it on (WDCTRL.EN).
- Software must **kick** it before the time runs out, by writing `0x5A5A` to WDKICK. Any other value counts as a failed kick and resets at once, so a program running wild is unlikely to keep it alive by accident.
- If it runs out, it **resets the computer**: the CPU and all the custom hardware restart, as at power-on, but the FPGA keeps its configuration.
- **LOCK:** writing WDCTRL with LOCK set makes the watchdog settings read-only until the next reset, so software cannot turn it off by mistake.
- **RESETWHY** tells software after starting up why the last reset happened: power-on, watchdog, reset button, a software-requested reset (spec 7), or a reset command over USB (spec 14).

The watchdog is off after reset, so the boot ROM and simple programs need not know about it.

## 6. Registers

In the system area at `0xF00000`. Spec 3 sets the final addresses. All registers are 32-bit and follow the 16-bit-halves rule (spec 10, section 4.1): the low-half write updates the whole register.

**Time counter:**

| Offset | Name | Bits | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `0x100` | TIMEHI | 31–0 | Upper 32 bits of TIME. Reading its upper half captures all 64 bits |
| `0x104` | TIMELO | 31–0 | Lower 32 bits (from the capture) |

**General timers** (timer n = 0–3 at `0x140 + n × 0x20`):

| Offset | Name | Bits | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `+0x00` | CTRL | EN (0), REPEAT (1), SRC (3–2), IRQ (4), DMA (5), DMACH (7–6) | Running; repeating; source (4.2); interrupt on underflow; start DMA channel DMACH on underflow |
| `+0x04` | PRESCALE | 15–0 | Clock divider for SRC 0: 100 MHz ÷ (PRESCALE + 1) |
| `+0x08` | RELOAD | 31–0 | Value loaded at each underflow in repeating mode |
| `+0x0C` | COUNT | 31–0 | Current count; writing sets it |
| `+0x10` | STAT | UNDER (0) | Underflowed; sticky, write 1 to clear |

**Watchdog:**

| Offset | Name | Bits | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `0x1C0` | WDCTRL | EN (0), LOCK (1) | On; lock settings until reset |
| `0x1C4` | WDTIME | 15–0 | Time allowed between kicks, in milliseconds |
| `0x1C8` | WDKICK | 15–0 | Write `0x5A5A` to restart the time; any other value resets at once |
| `0x1CC` | RESETWHY | POWER (0), WATCHDOG (1), BUTTON (2), SOFTWARE (3), USB (4), UPLOAD (5), KEYBOARD (6) | Cause of the last reset; read-only. USB and UPLOAD are the USB serial RESET and UPLOAD commands (spec 14); KEYBOARD is Ctrl + Alt + Delete (spec 16) |

**Interrupts:** each timer is its own source in the interrupt controller (spec 13), TIMER0–TIMER3, with its own vector. Default level 6. Starting a DMA channel works like a CPU write of START to that channel's CHCTRL (spec 11, section 8), and is independent of the interrupt.

## 7. FPGA resources

| Item | Resource |
|------|----------|
| 64-bit time counter, 4 timers with prescalers, watchdog | Estimate 350–500 LUTs |
| Block RAM, DSP | None |

## 8. Open points

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| T1 | A real-time clock (date and time that survives power-off) needs a battery-backed chip on the final PCB; until then the time of day can be set from the USB host or the SD card |
| T2 | Capture mode (save COUNT when an external pin changes), e.g. for measuring pulses on spare header pins |
| T3 | Should timers also be able to start the copper (COPJMP) or a sound channel? |

## 9. Tests

- **Time counter:** reading during a carry from the low to the high half always gives a consistent value.
- **Rates:** each source and several PRESCALE values; repeating and one-shot; RELOAD changes take effect at the next underflow only.
- **Chaining:** timers 0 and 1 chained as a 64-bit timer.
- **Interrupts and DMA starts:** each timer raises its own vector; a DMA start happens on underflow with no CPU involvement.
- **Watchdog:** expiry resets and sets RESETWHY.WATCHDOG; a wrong kick value resets at once; LOCK blocks changes until reset; the watchdog is off after reset.
