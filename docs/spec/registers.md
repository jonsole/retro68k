# Spec 3: Register map and memory map

Status: **draft for review**

This is the one place that lists every address in the machine: the memory map, the rules every register follows, and every register's final address. The bit layouts stay in each device's spec, linked from here, so they are described in only one place.

This spec also replaces spec 2 (memory map), which is folded in here.

## 1. Memory map

| CPU address | Size | What | Spec |
|-------------|------|------|------|
| `0x000000`–`0x007FFF` | 32 KB | Boot ROM overlay for CPU reads after reset (writes go to Chip RAM) | 7, section 3.2 |
| `0x000000`–`0x3FFFFF` | 4 MB | **Chip RAM** (the KS3's SRAM), shared by the CPU and all DMA. On 2 MB boards: `0x000000`–`0x1FFFFF`, and the rest is a bus error | 5 |
| `0x400000`–`0xDFFFFF` | 10 MB | Reserved (bus error) | |
| `0xE00000`–`0xE0FFFF` | 64 KB | **Custom block**: video, copper, DMA engine and audio registers; palette | Section 3 |
| `0xF00000`–`0xF0FFFF` | 64 KB | **System block**: interrupts, timers, serial, SD card, keyboard, system control, I2C | Section 4 |
| `0xF80000`–`0xF87FFF` | 32 KB | **Boot ROM** | 7, section 3 |
| Everything else | | Unmapped (bus error) | 1, section 6 |

**Who can reach what:**

| Area | CPU (supervisor) | CPU (user mode) | Copper | DMA engine |
|------|------------------|-----------------|--------|------------|
| Chip RAM | Yes | Yes | Read (its list) | Yes |
| Custom block | Yes | Yes, or bus error with SYSCON.PROTECT | Write | Read and write |
| System block | Yes | As above | No | No |
| Boot ROM | Read (write with ROMWE) | As above | No | Read |

## 2. Rules for all registers

1. **Size and order.** Every register is 32 bits wide, at an address that is a multiple of 4, stored big-endian as the 68000 expects. Its **high half** is at the register's address and its **low half** at address + 2.
2. **Writing in halves (CPU and copper).**
   - A write to the high half is held, not applied.
   - The next write to the low half of the same register writes both halves at once.
   - A low-half write on its own keeps the register's current high half.
   - A byte write behaves like a 16-bit write that keeps the other byte.

   The 68000's MOVE.L writes the high word first in every addressing mode except −(An), so ordinary code just works. DMA jobs write all 32 bits at once.

   **Don't use CLR.L on registers.** The 68000's CLR.L writes the low word first (seen in simulation with fx68k), so the high half would be held and never written. It also reads the register first, which takes a byte out of a FIFO data register. Use `MOVE.L #0,...` instead.
3. **Reading in halves.**
   - Reading the high half captures the whole register at that moment.
   - The next read of the low half returns the captured value, so a MOVE.L always gets a matching pair.
   - A low-half read on its own returns the current low half.
4. **Reading has no side effects,** except the three FIFO data registers in the system block (SERDATA, KBDATA, SDDATA), where reading takes data out. None of these are in the custom block, so DMA and the copper can never disturb anything by reading.
5. **Sticky flags** (marked W1C below) are cleared by writing 1 to them. Writing 0 leaves them alone.
6. **Set/clear registers** (DMACON): bit 15 = 1 sets the other bits written as 1; bit 15 = 0 clears them.
7. **Unused bits** read as 0; write them as 0.
8. **Unused addresses** inside the custom and system blocks read as 0 and ignore writes. Only the unmapped regions in section 1 give bus errors.
9. **Timing.** A register write takes effect as described in its spec: some at once (palette), some at a fixed point (layer settings before each line).
10. **16-bit registers** (BPLxDAT, BPLMOD and others) sit in the low half: write them with `MOVE.W` to the register's address + 2, or with `MOVE.L`.

**Access column key:** R = read only, W = write only, RW = read and write, W1C = sticky flags cleared by writing 1.

## 5. Interrupt sources and vectors

Listed in spec 13, section 4. With the default VECBASE of 64, vectors 64–87 are used for sources 0–23. Vector 31 is NMI, 24 is spurious, 2 is bus error.

## 6. One source for the numbers

Every register, field, layout and named number is also kept in **`fpga/regmap.def`**, a short text file. **`tools/regmap.py`** (standard Python, nothing to install) reads it and:

- checks it: 4-byte alignment, no overlaps, fields inside 31–0 and not overlapping, no name generated twice;
- checks it against the tables in this spec, so the two can't disagree;
- writes `firmware/include/hw.inc` (vasm), `firmware/include/hw.h` (C) and `fpga/rtl/regmap.vh` (Verilog).

GitHub runs `python3 tools/regmap.py --verify` on every push, which fails if the spec, the `.def` file and the generated files don't all agree. `tools/README.md` explains the file format and the generated names.

## 7. Open points

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| R2 | Bit layouts in each spec should be checked against the rules in section 2 once more when the generator is written |
| R3 | The palette write delay after a copper WAIT (spec 10, open point C2) should be listed here per video mode once known |

## 8. Tests

- **Decoding:** read every listed register after reset and check its reset value; read every free address and check 0; access every unmapped region and check a bus error.
- **Halves rules:** for a sample of registers in both blocks, check held high halves, low-half commits, low-half-only writes, byte writes, and captured reads.
- **Access rights:** the copper can't reach the system block or text screen; DMA can't reach the system block; PROTECT blocks user mode.
- **Generated files:** the assembler, C and Verilog files from the generator agree with this spec.
